//Function Prototype or Function Declaration
int addition (int a, int b); //Function Signature would be addition(int, int)

//Our main function
int main ()

  cout << "The result is " << z << endl; //Output to console

//Function Definition
int addition (int a, int b) //Notice - must match prototype/declaration

  int r; //integer declaration
  r = a + b; //arithmetic operation
  return r; //returns integer from function call
