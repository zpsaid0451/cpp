public:

 Race(); //Default Constructor
	// Name: StartRace()
	// 1. Resets length of race
	// 2. Increments the number of races for the player
	// 3. Sets up track (user chooses length of track) and populates obstacles
	// 4. Calls RaceOptions and calls GetStatus or calls ProgressRace (passes the user's choice)
	// 5. Checks to see if someone won (their location exceeds the length of the race)
	// 6. Displays the winner of race. If human player wins, increases a stat and increases wins
 // Preconditions - Race conditions set up
	// Postconditions - Race completed
	void StartRace();
	// Name: GetRacerInfo()
	// Desc - Gets the racer's name and populates the racer's name
	// Preconditions - Populates m_name in Racer
	// Postconditions - m_name is populated
	void GetRacerInfo();
	// Name: ProgressRace()
	// Desc - Does the following:
	// 1. Deals with the human player first.
 // 2. Randomly assigns (1 - 100) difficlty to all obstacles (regardless of location,
	//    all players have the same level difficulty for each round)
	// 3. Compares the BASE_SKILL + (5 * stat) to the obstacle difficulty to see if successfully
	//    navigated. Indicates if successful and increments location. If not successful,
	//    falls and increments falls
	// 4. Calls ProgressComputer to deal with computer
 // Preconditions - Player in race
	// Postconditions - Each racer either progresses to the next obstacle, or falls
	void ProgressRace(int);
	// Name: MainMenu()
	// Desc - Displays and manages menu
	// Preconditions - None
	// Postconditions - Returns number including exit
	bool MainMenu();
	// Name: RaceOptions()
	// Desc - Displays the race menu (display status, choose speed, choose agility, or choose jump)
	// Preconditions - None
 // Postconditions - Returns integer of user choice (status = 1, speed = 2, agility = 3, jump = 4)
	int RaceOptions();
	// Name: ManageGame
	// Desc - Calls RaceTitle, then calls GetRacerInfo. Continually calls MainMenu
	//        until the user chooses quit then it thanks the user and quits
	// Preconditions - Game instantiated
	// Postconditions - Calls RaceTitle, then calls GetRacerInfo. Continually calls MainMenu
//                  until the user chooses quit then it thanks the user and quits
	void ManageGame();
	// Name: ProgressComputer
	// Desc - Iterates over each computer player (players 2, 3, and 4) to see if they
	//        successfully navigate through an obstacle. Indicates if they make it or fall.
	//        Compares a random number between COMP_MIN and COMP_MAX to the obstacle difficulty
//        to see if they are successful
	// Preconditions - obstacleDifficulty is already calculated and passed to this function
	// Postconditions - For each computer player, they either make it and increment their
	//                  location or fall and remain on the same obstacle

	// Name: RaceTitle()
	// Desc - Title for Race (Do not edit)
